# Version Notes

## backup-working-version-2025-09-23

**Status**: ✅ WORKING VERSION

### Date: September 23, 2025

### Description
This is a stable, working version of the LINE Chat Summarizer AI application deployed on Railway.

### Key Features Working
- ✅ Frontend deployed at https://summarizer.orglai.com
- ✅ Backend API deployed at https://backend-production-8d6f.up.railway.app
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas connected successfully
- ✅ Health endpoints functioning
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Frontend-Backend communication established

### Important Fixes Applied
1. **MongoDB Connection Handling**: Backend can now run without MongoDB for testing, and gracefully handles connection failures
2. **Port Configuration**: Fixed Railway port configuration (both services use port 8080 internally)
3. **Environment Variables**: Hardcoded production backend URL in TRPC proxy to bypass Next.js standalone build limitations
4. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for production domain

### Known Configuration
- **Frontend URL**: https://summarizer.orglai.com
- **Backend URL**: https://backend-production-8d6f.up.railway.app
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB Atlas cluster connected
- **Ports**: Both services configured to use Railway's assigned PORT (8080)

### Deployment Notes
- Using Railway with NIXPACKS builder
- Next.js configured with `output: 'standalone'`
- Environment variables hardcoded for production due to Next.js limitations

### Critical Files
- `/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` - Contains hardcoded production backend URL
- `/backend/src/database/connection.js` - Handles MongoDB connection with fallback
- `/web/railway.json` & `/backend/railway.json` - Railway deployment configurations
